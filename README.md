### libros Book Binder
Converts calibre .epub files into a format that libros can understand. 
Currently only tested with converted .azw files, does not support images, untested italics and bold
because I haven't got all the parts for my Open Book yet.
Based off documentation in [this](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1533103137455751168) twitter thread.
oh and btw I don't even know if libros will understand this.
Have fun!
